## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Frontend**: EJS templates, TailwindCSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Liquibase for migrations
- **Authentication**: Passport.js
- **AI Integration**: Local AI model support (Mistral, VLLM, Ollama)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL (v15+ recommended)
- [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/community) (for database migrations)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized setup)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd share-my-recipe
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure the database
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running
- Update environment variables or `src/index.ts` with your database credentials
- Create a database or use the default `postgres` database

### 4. Run database migrations
```bash
liquibase update
```

### 5. Start the app
```bash
npm start
```

The app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üîç AI Search Setup (Optional)

The application supports various LLM backends for enhanced recipe search:

- **Local AI**: Connect to LocalAI, Ollama, or VLLM
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `LLM_MODEL`: Specify the model to use (e.g., 'mistral')

If the AI service is unavailable, the app falls back to standard search mechanisms.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: Register and log in to create and manage recipes
2. **Recipe Creation**: Add recipes with title, description, ingredients, and instructions
3. **Recipe Discovery**: Browse all recipes or search by keywords, categories, or cuisines
4. **AI-Powered Search**: Get personalized recommendations based on natural language requests like "vegetarian pasta without mushrooms" or "kosher desserts"
5. **Favorites**: Save recipes you love to your favorites list for easy access
6. **Profile Management**: View and edit your profile information
